# Turtle predator

## Overview
This project consists of two ROS2 nodes: a Turtle Spawner and a Turtle Controller. The Turtle Spawner node is responsible for spawning turtles in the turtlesim simulator, while the Turtle Controller node controls a turtle to catch other spawned turtles.

## Structure
The project contains the following files:
- turtle_spawner.cpp: Spawns turtles and publishes their information.
- turtle_controller.cpp: Controls a turtle to catch other spawned turtles based on their positions.

## Setup and Usage
### Prerequisites
- ROS2 (Foxy, Galactic, or Humble recommended)
- turtlesim package
- Custom message and service definitions (my_robot_interfaces)
